# GeoGallery

This git repository is for the group project in PROG39402: Advanced Android Application Development taught by professor Yash Shah. The project was joint effort by the team of  Francis Starr and Jordan Way which collectively form the team called StarrWay. This course was completed in the fall semester of 2020 at Sheridan College, Trafalgar campus.

## Technologies Uses

* Kotlin
* SQLite
* Google Maps API

## Premise

Consider this scenario. You are a traveller going to interesting places taking photos of your travels using your smartphone. You want to tag every photo of your travels with the exact GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken. This is made easy to do using GeoGallery. With GeoGallery, you can add pins on a google map then also add additional information for each pin such as title, description, date and a photo of the location for that pin. For each pin: description, date and photo are all optional fields while title is required. If you decide that you donâ€™t want to keep any specific pin or you want to change information then you can do that too as each pin has the ability to edit and delete.

## Documentation

StarrWay recognizes that providing just the code alone of a git repository is not suffficient to properly explain an application. As such, there is folder in this repo called documentation. In the documentation folder, you will find 5 useful files that are for documentation and not at all part of the code. 
* project instructions provided by the professor (project_instructions.pdf)
* template for submitted proposal provided by the prof (project_plan_template.pdf)
* submitted project proposal (submitted_project_plan.pdf)
* visual mockups for most of the use cases in the submitted project proposal (visualMockups.pdf)
* screenshot of final project mark which is 94% (finalGrade.PNG)

## Installation

GeoGallery is an out of the box solution. All you need is Android Studio and Gradle and it should work for you. It uses SQLite as its databse which means the database used is built into the application itself. So no need to connect to external databases.

## Demonstration

StarrWay recognizes that there are parties who are interested in viewing how the application without necessarily going through all the steps of installing it. Luckily, a video demonstration was required for the project and the video is made public on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdZ4QoesIsg
